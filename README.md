# DSC 381 â€“ Probability and Simluation Based Inference

## Homework 1, Problem 11
In this problem, we simulate the following:
1. A population of 10,000 (the problem shows 10,000 and 1,000 and I chose  bigger) who have a disease.
2. We then simluate a test on the population to determine the presence of the disease, with an accuracy of 99.9% (0.999) and a false positive rate of 0.5% (0.005)
3. Next, we compare the test result to the known presence of the disease
4. Finally, we plot the outcome as the disease presence in the population ranges from 0.01 to 0.50

**Interpretation:** As the presence of the disease in the population increases, the probability of the test returning a true positive increases exponentially, seemingly approaching the expected accuracy rate of 0.999 (99.9%).
